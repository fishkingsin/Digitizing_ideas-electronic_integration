Digitizing ideas - electronic integration
===============

Introduction
===============
SCM 2014 OWeek Workshop
This repo is simple demostarte a concept of digital media and electronic integration 

* Duration is a timeline for creative coding. Create live performances, interactive installations, and music visualizations by synchronously composing servos, lighting, and projection. [duration.cc](http://www.duration.cc/). This time Duration help you to plan your color changes.
* Processing is a programming language, development environment, and online community. Java base. This time processing helps you to transform data to controller broad.
* Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. This time arduino helps you control LED Strip.
